Here is a concise but detailed English description of your program:

***

This project is a **QR-based event check-in system** built with Python and Flask.  
It reads participant data from an Excel file, generates unique tokens, and creates QR codes for each participant linking to a custom check-in URL. The participants’ names, phone numbers, and tokens are stored in a local SQLite database.  

When a user scans their QR code, the Flask web app validates the token, marks it as used, and displays a confirmation message. The system can also be extended to send QR codes automatically via WhatsApp or SMS using the Twilio API for event invitations and attendance tracking.  

The project structure includes:
- `generate_qr_from_excel.py`: Reads the Excel file, inserts participants into the database, and generates personalized QR codes.  
- `app.py`: Hosts the Flask web server handling QR code scans and verifies tokens.  
- `generate_db.py`: Creates the database schema for participants.  
- `render.yaml`: Contains deployment instructions for Render’s hosting platform.  

This automated setup provides a simple, scalable solution for managing event access and participant verification through QR codes.
